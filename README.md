Best known materials (for me) that leads to real understanding. These tend to have pretty visualizations and extensive links to related concepts ([motivation](https://www.quora.com/Do-highly-intuitive-thinkers-generally-feel-stifled-by-highly-proof-based-rigor-heavy-mathematics-eg-that-taught-at-the-undergrad-grad-level/answer/William-Bulmer-2)). Further technical details could be searched elsewhere.

[Arrogant](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/7gqhlc/what_to_say_instead_of_trivially/) sources are generally excluded.

Textbooks are usually contemporary and readable.
